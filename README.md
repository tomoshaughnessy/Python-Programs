# Python-Programs
This game was meant to be presented at the annual RCBC Science Slam. My
station had the game displayed by a projector, a chair for the child to sit,
and a mouse for the child to launch the rocket.
Families cheered for their children (3 years and older) as they 'saved Earth' from the meteor. 
Older children tried to break the game and asked what language it was written in.
My mom's friend later told me that her 5 year old son said, "I want to make games like Tommy when I grow up"
after playing the game at Science Slam.

The UI is built using the tkinter package. It hasn't been updated since the 2017 Science Slam.
